# Nmap Network Scan and Wireshark Packet Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to scan a local network using **Nmap** and analyze network activity with **Wireshark**. The goal is to learn how to detect active devices, identify open ports, recognize exposed services, assess potential risks, and observe real-time packet exchange during a port scan.

## Objectives

- Discover devices connected to the local Wi-Fi network.
- Detect open TCP ports and identify services running on them.
- Analyze potential security risks of exposed services.
- Use Wireshark to view and understand network traffic during scans.
- Save scan results in text and HTML format for documentation.
