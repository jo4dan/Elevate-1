Open Ports and Risks:

22 (SSH)
Secure way to remotely access the router. Risky if weak passwords or default credentials are used.

23 (Telnet)
Very old and insecure method of remote access. Sends data in plain text. Should be disabled on modern routers.

53 (DNS)
Used for domain name resolution. Usually fine on routers, but can be abused for DNS poisoning if misconfigured.

80 (HTTP)
Web interface for managing the router. If not protected by a strong password, anyone on your network can access and change settings.

1900 (UPnP)
Used for auto-configuring network devices. Commonly exploited by malware if UPnP is exposed or misconfigured.

ðŸ”¹ 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0.3
All ports are closed.
These devices are not currently exposing any services, which is a good thing.

ðŸ”¹ 192.168.0.7 (Your Device)
Open Ports and Risks:

22 (SSH)
If youâ€™re using SSH for remote access to your machine, itâ€™s fine â€” but make sure it uses strong passwords or keys. Otherwise, itâ€™s a way in.

139 (NetBIOS-SSN) and 445 (Microsoft-DS)
These are related to Windows file sharing (SMB). If not needed, they should be turned off â€” these ports are often targeted by malware like ransomware for spreading across networks.
